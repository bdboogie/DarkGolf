This section provides advice on how to set up open competitions using a consistent process and current systems.

The club open competitions should be confirmed by October for the following year alongside the club golf event calendar. To allow the opens to be promoted as soon as possible all relevant details about the event should be agreed for the October deadline.  As most events are repeated annually unless a retrospective review dictates otherwise the format of the competitionm should look to mirror previous years.

Even tried and tested formulas get tired, after each event it is useful to hold a retrospective looking at what worked, what didnt work and what needs to change.
