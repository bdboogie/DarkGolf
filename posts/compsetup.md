This section provides advice on how to set up competitions using defined process and current systems.

The club competitons for the golfing calendar are typically decided on by October  for the following year. To have a complete picture you should aim to have all the competiton information from the clubs sections to sit along side the club calendar. 

The order is to get the event in to the club calendar then shortly afterwards create the competition in the booking system along with any restrictions.

Weekend comps - 3 ball and four ball
Once in the diary these are best added as a one time process at the start of the year owing to the context switching of need to refer backwards and forwards to the online diary.  The competition is created in BRS and membership category eligibilty assigned.  You can also specify when the comnpetition goes live which at present is set up for 9am Friday the week before the event (8 day priority), with the option of 9pm booking the day before from the club house. The associated competiton times is 7am- 1pm.
Start time is set to 7am to prevent visitors going out ahead of members, the competiton extends to finish at 1pm in the rule but this can be extended or shorted as needed in teh next step ( note if extending the time in the rule should also be lengthen to assit booking via the apps). 

After the event has been created the times should then be blocked out on the timesheet. Using a link from the rule you can add the event with prepopulated details, and make use of the bulk creation. Note that for 3 ball teetimes an X need to be placed in PLayer 4 to prevent fourballs interferring with a 3ball comp.  (This detail is taken care of automatically by the visitor greenfee rule to the point that before 12:30 vistors can only book in a maximum of threes)

Time booked out for the comp can be released for visitor books depending on need.  If timetimes are free on the Tuesday following booking on, the 10:30-11:30am and 12:30pm onwards slots have been popular for genrating visitor greenfees.  To do this clear the competition reference( name and type and any player details e.g. 'X') from time slot.

Special comps scrambles adn jubilee rosebowl ( latter needs more thought)

notes on Mixed , typically number of people that take part and the time to allocate to avoid saturating tee sheet but also getting peopel back in on time.  Mention can extend either side and how far in advance to make availabel , that ges for some saturday comps too again i.e. the Rosebowl

Not really for this page so put another one together but need to highlight the step for societies , e.g. ladies exchange day, 
Preparation time December - December takes approx 7 hours

Handicap Allowance for Texas Scrambles
There have never really been any specific rules regarding the handicap allowance when playing Texas Scramble. However, the most common handicap allowance used when playing the game has been 10% of the total of the three or four players handicaps.

However, due to the new World Handicap System, this has changed and the handicap system used is based on the number of players in each team. You can see the exact recommended numbers below:

Scramble (4 players) 25% / 20% / 15% / 10% from the lowest to highest handicap
Scramble (3 players) 30% / 20% / 10% from the lowest to highest handicap
Scramble (2 players) 35% Low / 15% High
For example if you’re a team of 4 with handicaps 5, 10, 15 and 20, your team Texas Scramble handicap would be 7.5.

Player A: 1.25 (5 x 25%) + Player B: 2 (10 x 20%) + Player C: 2.25 (15 x 15%) + Player D: 2 (20 x 10%) = 7.5 


Generally in Texas Scramble, you also don’t round up or down the handicaps. So, if the team above scored 71 gross, then they would take away their handicap of 7.5 giving them a net score of 63.5 which is what they would mark on the card and return. 

This is however by no means a strict rule. Various clubs run Texas Scramble competitions in different ways and may use a different way of working out the handicap allowance but this is the data provided based on the World Handicap System.
