weekend comps - 3 ball and four ball

special comps scrambles adn jubilee rosebowl ( latter needs more thought)

notes on Mixed , typically number of people that take part and the time to allocate to avoid saturating tee sheet but also getting peopel back in on time.  Mention can extend either side and how far in advance to make availabel , that ges for some saturday comps too again i.e. the Rosebowl

Not really for this page so put another one together but need to highlight the step for societies , e.g. ladies exchange day, 
Preparation time December - December takes approx 7 hours



Yellow Peril 3 Man Medal
16 holes (Miss out 11th & 12th) - Par 62
Players to score on the following blocks of holes
  Player 1 holes 1,2,3,4,5
  Player 2 holes 6,7,8,9,10
  Player 3 holes 13,14,15,16,17
  Best 2 score to count on the 18th
Clean and place is in play , rake and place in bunkers.

With the shortest day fast approaching we have knocked the competition down to 16 holes. Unfortunately due to the wet weather we are closing holes 11 and 12 not so much for the state of holes themselves but more the perilous path down from the 11th.  

In coming weeks we'll look to move the 11th tee down to the bottom to allow those playing earlier in the day the option to play a full 18. I hope this doesnt spoil your enjoyment of your golf this weekend, I'll leave that to the weather. Apologies to those that this inconveniences.  Enjoy.

Handicap Allowance for Texas Scrambles
There have never really been any specific rules regarding the handicap allowance when playing Texas Scramble. However, the most common handicap allowance used when playing the game has been 10% of the total of the three or four players handicaps.

However, due to the new World Handicap System, this has changed and the handicap system used is based on the number of players in each team. You can see the exact recommended numbers below:

Scramble (4 players) 25% / 20% / 15% / 10% from the lowest to highest handicap
Scramble (3 players) 30% / 20% / 10% from the lowest to highest handicap
Scramble (2 players) 35% Low / 15% High
For example if you’re a team of 4 with handicaps 5, 10, 15 and 20, your team Texas Scramble handicap would be 7.5.

Player A: 1.25 (5 x 25%) + Player B: 2 (10 x 20%) + Player C: 2.25 (15 x 15%) + Player D: 2 (20 x 10%) = 7.5 


Generally in Texas Scramble, you also don’t round up or down the handicaps. So, if the team above scored 71 gross, then they would take away their handicap of 7.5 giving them a net score of 63.5 which is what they would mark on the card and return. 

This is however by no means a strict rule. Various clubs run Texas Scramble competitions in different ways and may use a different way of working out the handicap allowance but this is the data provided based on the World Handicap System.
