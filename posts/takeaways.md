A word of advice...

1. Listen to the old guard, heed their advice, but always make your own decision , you'll be the one living with it.
2. Dont be afraid to do something for the first time, even if it ends up being the last time.
3. Keep the membeship at heart , this isnt about you, when the membership are happy you'll feel happier too.
