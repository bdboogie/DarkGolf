The following provides suggestions on how to organise your Captain's Day based on traditional and novel ideas from the past.  Of course its your day, so dont be afraid to go off piste and put your stamp all over it.

## On the Course
### Competition
The Captain's Week usually encompasses events for a Ladies competition, the Mens competition and a Mixed competition.  The format, tees and rules are set at the discretion of the Captain but traditionally the Mens competition is a White tee medal event, this latter fact makes it easier for any gross prizes.
### Prizes
The distribution of prizes again is at the Captain's discretion.  You will be expected to cover this from the coast of your membership, the competition fee of the day (all of which is donated to your prize fund) and any additional funds you care to raise on or around the day.  
Back in the day we had four divisions and often extended prizes to fourth & fifth place.  The prizes on offer have ranged from top end golf gear, through to electronics and even one Captain putting on portraits of the course as the main prizes.  Discarded prizes from that latter category are still found turning up in local charity shops.  
Special prizes presented by the Captain include the best Gross to reward your scratch players who support you playing in the league, and a prize for the past captains in recognition of all the advice and support you draw from them in your year.
A nearest the pin prize is a common feature of the day.  It has been run from most holes although only on one occasion have all four holes up for grabs.  When we had juniors they use to look after it from the second hole, the 6th is the least popular to use, the 16th helps with bringing in the measuring equipment, but if you are going to camp at the halfway hut then it makes sense to watch the attempts from the 10th.  You will be surprised at the success rate of people making the green in one, typically its about 1 in 9. 
### Halfway house
Whatever you are going to provide at the halfway house remember you've got to get it there, there are several examples of captains getting their cars stuck attempting to prepare for the day or partners and family roped in to carrying cases and kegs of alcohol from the top car park down to the 10th, its a lot longer than you thinking when you're carrying 20kg.

_Shelter_ - Although not essential a shelter or marque helps designate where you'd like the players to conjugate whilst sharing a moment with you.  It also provides a little protection should the weather turn.  
_Water_ - Ask the greenkeepers to take up a barrel ahead of the day.  You'll need this if you are cooking hotdogs, making hot drinks or if washing up as you go along.  
_Food_ - burgers, hotdogs ("plenty onion"), sandwiches, scones and cake are all welcome treats at the halfway point for your guests.  There are a mix of approaches for how you provide snacks, in the days of the caravan the ladies section charged for the hot dogs, more recently captains have provided free refreshments or linked them with raffle tickets or a charity donation.  They'll always be the miserable member who fails to contribute but insists on filling their bag with as many freebies as they can for the rest of the round.  
_Drinks_ - Beer, Whiskey , Cider and the odd soft or warm drink are usual.  fair.  Most people will want to toast you if you provide whiskey.  Good luck to the captain that fails to provide some form of liquid refreshment.  
_Accessories_ - Plates, cutlery cups and napkins, there isn't much worse on your next tee shot after the half way house than having to contend with ketchup covered hands.  Its your choice how you'd like to provide drinks and food, plastic and paper cups make for easy tidying up but are not as good for the environment.  There are a few mugs in the halfway house but it is worth checking the week before to see how many have survived since their last use.  
_Other things to consider_
* Stove
* Washing up bowl
* Ice and bucket
* Till and float
* Auction slips or raffle tickets
* Charity posters
* Apologies list - you can leave this in the office but why not make people face you when they tell you they are happy to pick up a prize but not turn up for your day.


## In the Clubhouse

### Captain's Invite
Meet and greet your guests ahead of the main presentation and function with a invitational drink in the snug.  On occasion these events have been held at Captain's houses ahead of the event but more commonly take place at the club.  The invite can be open to all but more commonly the early part of this event is a chance to meet and thank those at the club that have helped you out. You can then open it up to the rest of the club.

## Other Suggestions

### Friends event
The course is booked out to you for the day so why not open it up to friends and family to enjoy the day in a separate fun event.
### Auction
A good way to generate money for your charity, or cover any shortfall in the prizes is to hold a silent auction.  Ask your peers at other clubs to donate a fourball then hold an auction by getting members to make bids when they stop off at the halfway house.  Announce the winners at the presentation on the evening, with a nod to how much the charity has made.
### Charity Raffle
Similar to the auction but requires a bit more work getting charitable donations from people.  Raffle tickets can be sold in exchange for food and drink at the halfway house.
