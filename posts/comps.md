## Mixed Comps
The club captain is responsible for scheduling and organising all mixed competitions. In recent years Frank and Betty Beaumont have assisted in this however this is liable to change as both are considering taking a step back from golf in the near future. 
The mixed comps have all kinds of rules depending on whether it is a foursomes / fourball, greensomes in terms of shots received / handicaps and frankly I still don’t understand them. The best bet if Frank and or Betty are not able to assist is to ask
