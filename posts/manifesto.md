<h3>Dear Baildon Golf Club Members,</h3>


I am honored to announce my candidacy for the position of Treasurer at the upcoming Annual General Meeting. Our organization faced unprecedented financial challenges in 2022, generating a eyewatering full year £43k loss and the unexplained negative discrepancy in audited accounts of 2021 seeing £30K of profit and a number of officials disappear without explanation. As your Treasurer, I will act on behalf of the membership and commit to implementing strategic financial measures to address and rectify this situation, ensuring the long-term financial health of our club.

Key Points of my Manifesto:
* Comprehensive Financial Audit:
* Strategic Budget Management
* Diversification of Revenue Streams
* Financial Training and Awareness
* Regular Financial Reporting
* Risk Management
* Collaboration with Stakeholders
(see below for further detail on the seven key points)

Together, we can overcome the current financial challenges and pave the way for a prosperous future for Baildon Golf Club. I am dedicated to ensuring the responsible and effective management of our finances, working diligently to restore financial stability and drive sustainable growth.

Your support will enable us to build a resilient financial foundation for our organization. I am eager to contribute my skills and commitment to this crucial role as Treasurer.

Thank you for considering my candidacy as your Treasurer at this years AGM on Thursday 14th December at 8PM.

Sincerely,
John Megson
